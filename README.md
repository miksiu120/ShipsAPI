# Ship API

## Overview

This project is an exercise created for a recruitment process. It demonstrates the implementation of an API for managing ships of two distinct types:

- **Passenger Ship**: Contains a list of passengers.
- **Tanker Ship**: Stores fuel in tanks, where each tank can hold a different type of fuel.

## Features

- Object-oriented design using abstract factory and polymorphism for ship creation.
- API endpoints for managing ships and their specific attributes.

## Purpose

The exercise provided an opportunity to practice API development and testing, showcasing skills in designing and implementing scalable and maintainable solutions.
